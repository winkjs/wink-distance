// ### cosine
/**
 *
 * Computes the cosine distance between the input bag of words (bow)
 * `a` and `b` and returns a value between 0 and 1.
 *
 * @method bow.cosine
 * @param {object} a the first set of bows i.e word (i.e. key) and it's frequency
 * (i.e. value) pairs.
 * @param {object} b the second set of bows.
 * @return {number} cosine distance between `a` and `b`.
 *
 * @example
 * // bow for "the dog chased the cat"
 * var a = { the: 2, dog: 1, chased: 1, cat: 1 };
 * // bow  for "the cat chased the mouse"
 * var b = { the: 2, cat: 1, chased: 1, mouse: 1 };
 * cosine( a, b );
 * // -> 0.14285714285714302
 * // Note the bow could have been created directly by
 * // using "tokens.bow()" from the "wink-nlp-utils".
