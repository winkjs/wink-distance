 *
 * Computes the levenshtein distance between two strings. This distance is computed
 * as the number of deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform a
 * string to another. Levenshtein distance is always an integer with a value of 0 or more.
 *
 * @method string.levenshtein
 * @param {string} str1 first string.
 * @param {string} str2 second string.
 * @return {number} levenshtein distance between `str1` and `str2`.
 * @example
 * levenshtein( 'example', 'sample' );
 * // ->  2
 * levenshtein( 'distance', 'difference' );
 * // -> 5
